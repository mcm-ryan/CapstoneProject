# Team 8: Capstone Project

Team Members: Mark Lopez, Ryan McMaster, Matthew Magnotta, and Jean-Jacques Akpakoun

This repository will host code for our Capstone Project. 

We intend to create an application that will...
-  Integrates voice recognition and authenticated voice commands with a voice recognition ML library.  
-  Authenticate and validate commands from system users to control actions in various simple multi-player games (tic-tac-toe, connect 4, battleship).
-  Record user command actions (valid and invalid) in an event streaming platform and present them in a user interface.
