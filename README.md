# Welcome to Tic Talk Toe!

This repository hosts our code for our Capstone Project. Our sponsor, Northrop Grumman, has tasked us with creating a Voice Recognition/Identification application that allows user to play multiplayer games using voice commands. 

## Steps to run the code:
  *Assuming you already have node installed on your local machine*

  1) Clone the repository into a local directory of your choice.
     
  2) 'cd' into the client folder and run the following commands:
     
```
npm i
npm start
```
     
  3) 'cd' into the server folder and run the following commands:
     
```
npm i
npm start
```

  4) The client and server should now be running on ports 3000 and 3001 respectively.
